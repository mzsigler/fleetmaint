# fleetmaint
A fleet maintenance program I'm working on for my jobby job. 
This is (at least right now) a very basic python + sqlite program to track basic maintenance for a rental fleet. 
If I can stay motivated, I plan to add support for document storage (scanning receipts and associating them with an inventory unit), alerts that let you know when a car is due for an oil change, and a simple GUI.
